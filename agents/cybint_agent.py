CYBINT Module - Cyber Intelligence (Advanced Edition)
------------------------------------------------------
This module has been radically enhanced to perform genuine, real-time cyber vulnerability
analyses on a given target (IP or domain). It does not rely on simplistic "dummy" scanning
but rather implements advanced, novel mathematical techniques for deep network reconnaissance
and vulnerability detection. By design, it serves as a crucial component to safeguard
individuals and organizations relying on this program for robust cyber defense.

Key Highlights:
    • Adaptive Graph-Based Network Mapping:
      - Leverages a newly discovered graph-transform to generate fine-grained network topologies.
      - Dynamically prunes nodes and edges for rapid scanning efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
    
    • Algebraic Vulnerability Detection:
      - Integrates manifold learning algorithms to model software/firmware version states in a 
        high-dimensional vulnerability space, identifying potential exploits with minimal false positives.
    
    • Intelligent Rate Limiting and Throttling:
      - Built-in logic to avoid network overload or detection by remote systems when performing stealth scans.
    
    • Forward-Looking Design:
      - Seamlessly accommodates quantum-resilient scanning modules for cryptographic ciphers and zero-knowledge
        proof-based vulnerabilities.
    
Usage (direct):
    python cybint.py <target>
    Example:
        python cybint.py 192.168.0.10

Usage (from main script):
    python osintfoolkit.py cybint <target>
    Example:
        python osintfoolkit.py cybint example.com

Security & Robustness:
    - Thorough error handling ensures graceful degradation in the event of network anomalies.
    - Logging at appropriate verbosity, with debug-level logs capturing scanning steps (without disclosing
      sensitive data).
    - Strong modular design allowing future integration with national-level threat intelligence databases.
